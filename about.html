    <p><h1>About Me</h1></p>
        <p>Hello everyone, my name is April, I’m a non-traditional student here at the <a target="_blank" href="https://uri.edu"> University of Rhode Island</a>. <br> 
            In my “previous life” I was a high school teacher and vice principal (2000-2022).<br> 
            Currently I am seeking a new degree in <a target="_blank" href="https://web.uri.edu/human-development/"> Human Development and Family Science </a>. <br> 
            I would like to take my 20+ year career experience, mix it with HDF, and help young <br> 
            people through life’s challenges as a licensed counselor.</p>
            <p>I enjoy all kinds of physical activities, but my favorite indoor exercise activity is <a target="_blank" href="https://getsupernatural.com"> Supernatural </a>, a virtual reality workout app <br> 
                for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3/"> Meta Quest </a> VR system. 
            I use it as a form practice for my real-life kickboxing.</p>
