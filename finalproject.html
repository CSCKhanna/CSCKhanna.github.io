    <p> Welcome to my CSC Final Project Page  <br>
        This program is an interactive game called "Poke a Moji" (inspired by mole mash) where players <br>
        poke a bitmoji character within a certain time frame to grow a moji swarm. The game consists of several <br>
       scenes: splash screen, game screen, end screen, and a thank you screen.  <br><br>
    On the splash screen, players are greeted with a colorful flashing background, <br>
    shadowed text, and instructions to start the game. They are also introduced to the <br>
        main character, my bitmoji. Clicking the "Start" button transitions the game to the game scene. <br><br> 
    In the game screen, the player has 10 seconds to click on the white-shirted bitmoji <br>
character to earn points and grow the swarm of smaller mojis. The background color <br>
changes randomly with each refresh. As the game progresses, the frame rate increases<br>
based on the player's score.   <br><br>
    When the game time reaches 10 seconds, the game transitions to the end screen. <br>
Here, the player can see their final score and have options to either restart the game, <br>
continue growing their swarm, go back to the home screen, or view a thank you message to <br>
the CSC teaching team. The thank you screen displays the names of team members along with<br
 a thank you message. The player can choose to return to the home screen from here as well.<br><br><br><br>
HOW TO PLAY:<br><br>
1. Poke the white-shirted bitmoji character within 10 seconds to grow a swarm.<br><br>
2. The splash screen appears with a flashing background and instructions. <br>
Click the "Start" button to begin the game. <br><br>
3. On the main game screen you'll see a white-shirted bitmoji character. <br>
Your task is to click (poke) on bitmoji as many times as possible within the 10-second time limit.<br><br>
4. To poke the bitmoji, click on it with your mouse. Each successful click increases the moji swarm size by one.<br><br>
5. Your current swarm size is displayed in the top left corner of the screen. Keep an eye on it as you play.<br><br>
6. A timer at the top of the screen shows you how much time you have left to poke the bitmoji. <br>
Once the timer reaches 10 seconds, the game will end.<br><br>

7. On the end scree your swarm size will be displayed along with options to restart the game, <br>
continue playing to grow the swarm, go back to the home screen, or view a thank you message to the <br>
CSC teaching team.<br><br>
8. If you want to play again, simply click the "Restart a New Swarm" button on the end screen. <br>
This will set the swarm size and time to zero.<br><br>

9.  If you want to continue playing with the swarm of mojis, click the "Keep Swarm Growing" button <br>
on the end screen. This will reset your time and add to your current swarm size.<br><br>
10. To view a thank you message to the CSC teaching team, click the "Thank you CSC Team!" <br>
button on the end screen. You will have the option to restart the game from this screen. <br><br><br><br>
Have fun poking the bitmoji and see how big your moji swarm can be before the time runs out!
