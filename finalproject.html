    <p> Welcome to my CSC Final Project Page  <br><br>
        The program I've created is an interactive game called "Poke a Moji" (inspired by mole mash) <br>
        where players poke a bitmoji character within a certain time frame to grow a moji swarm. The <br>
        game consists of several scenes: splash screen, game screen, end screen, and a thank you screen.  <br><br>
        On the splash screen, players are greeted with a colorful flashing background, shadowed text, <br> 
        and instructions to start the game. They are also introduced to the main character, my bitmoji. <br> 
        Clicking the "Start" button transitions the game to the game scene. <br><br> 
        In the game screen, the player has 10 seconds to click on the white-shirted bitmoji character <br>
        to earn points and grow the swarm of smaller mojis. The background color changes randomly with <br>
        each refresh. As the game progresses, the frame rate increases based on the player's score.   <br><br>
        When the game time reaches 10 seconds, the game transitions to the end screen. Here, the player <br> 
        can see their final score and have options to either restart the game, continue growing their <br>
        swarm, go back to the home screen, or view a thank you message to the CSC teaching team. The thank<br> 
        you screen displays the names of team members along with a thank you message. The player can choose<br> 
        to return to the home screen from here as well.<br><br><br><br>
